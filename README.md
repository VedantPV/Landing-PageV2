# Landing-PageV2
This project involved creating a landing page that most modern websites utilise nowadays.
It took several days and one start over, but it was done and I was taught quite a bit about
CSS coding.
Organization and efficiency was key here, which meant minimum brute forcing benefitted far greater.
By using flexbox properties extensively and organizing sections by containers, I was able to create a 
plain, boilerplate landing page.
